## TRY THIS AT HOME
Thank you for spending a day with us learning about Information Technology at Red River College.
If you want to do all of the activities again, all of the files you will need are in this GitHub.

Inside of each of these folders is a *Notes* folder. Find a copy of each sessionâ€™s instructions inside each of these folders.
```
01 Web Programming
02 Database
03 Networking
04 Internet Security
```

For this year's *TechCamp* we are using an online tool, aka. an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), that you can run from your web browser:

TODO: Add links to each section. Make sure all the snippets and starting code are in the notes files. Add video links into md instructions.
